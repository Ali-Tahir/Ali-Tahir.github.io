<h2 id="01-GitHub-Student-Developer-Pack">01 - GitHub Student Developer Pack</h2>
<p>You will get all the tools you’ll need to build and ship your projects like a star while you are a student. All you need is a University email that you’ll use to create a GitHub account or make it as primary email in your existing GitHub account and you are good to go for the application!</p>
<p>You will be asked to provide proof that you are currently, a student, and as they say, the whole process of approval can take up to 24 hours once you submit your application. I recommend checking your email once you applied you might get instant access like myself.</p>
